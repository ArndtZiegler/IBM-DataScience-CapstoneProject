# Final Report

## Introduction/Business Problem

Many people having to move to another city seek a similar neighborhood to live in as they are used to. Whereas some criteria for neighborhoods being similar are subjective in nature, e.g. the feel/vibe or liking for other people living there, there are also objective measures: the venues defining the face of the neighborhood, like parks, sights, restaurants etc.

To help those people choose a neighborhood in their new city to move to, comparing the venues to their old city's neighborhood provides a valuable assistance in their decision. To be precise, clustering neighborhoods of both cities based on venue distribution enables the stakeholders to take neighborhoods in the same cluster as their old one into closer selection. This significantly narrows down the neighborhoods they have to subjectively inspect to reach a decision, saving them valuable time.

We use the cities of Toronto and Manhattan.

## Data Acquisition

First we need a list of neighborhoods in both cities and add geospatial data to it. With these lists we query the Foursquare API using the geospatial data in them to get venues and their categories for every neighborhood. From there we can clean, wrangle and cluster the data.

We parse the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M&oldid=1012118802) that lists all neighborhoods of Toronto to get the list of Toronto neighborhoods. We use the `read_html` function of the pandas library. Thereby we have to resort to an older version of the wikipedia page, since `read_html` cannot handle the new layout. We get a pandas dataframe which looks like this:


||Postal Code|Borough|Neighborhood|
---|---|---|---
|0|M1B|Scarborough|Malvern, Rouge|
|1|M1C|Scarborough|Rouge Hill, Port Union, Highland Creek|
|2|M1E|Scarborough|Guildwood, Morningside, West Hill|
|3|M1G|Scarborough|Woburn|
|4|M1H|Scarborough|Cedarbrae|

To add the geospatial coordinates, we merge a CSV-file provided by the course creators on the postal code. The resulting dataframe's head is:

||Postal Code|Borough|Neighborhood|Latitude|Longitude|
---|---|---|---|---|---
|0|M1B|Scarborough|Malvern, Rouge|43.806686|-79.194353|
|1|M1C|Scarborough|Rouge Hill, Port Union, Highland Creek|43.784535|-79.160497|
|2|M1E|Scarborough|Guildwood, Morningside, West Hill|43.763573|-79.188711|
|3|M1G|Scarborough|Woburn|43.770992|-79.216917|
|4|M1H|Scarborough|Cedarbrae|43.773136|-79.239476|

The analogous dataframe for Manhattan we extract from a geojson-file that the course creators provide


||Borough|Neighborhood|Latitude|Longitude|
---|---|---|---|---
|0|Manhattan|Marble Hill|40.876551|-73.910660|
|1|Manhattan|Chinatown|40.715618|-73.994279|
|2|Manhattan|Washington Heights|40.851903|-73.936900|
|3|Manhattan|Inwood|40.867684|-73.921210|
|4|Manhattan|Hamilton Heights|40.823604|-73.949688|

For both cities we query venue data from the Foursquare API with a radius of 500m and a limit of 100 venues per neighborhood. The resulting dataframe looks like this:

||Neighborhood |Neighborhood Latitude |Neighborhood Longitude |Venue |Venue Latitude |Venue Longitude |Venue Category|
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
0|Malvern, Rouge |43.806686 |-79.194353 |Wendyâ€™s |43.807448 |-79.199056 |Fast Food Restaurant|
1|Rouge Hill, Port Union, Highland Creek |43.784535 |-79.160497 |Great Shine Window Cleaning |43.783145 |-79.157431 |Home Service|
2|Rouge Hill, Port Union, Highland Creek |43.784535 |-79.160497 |Royal Canadian Legion |43.782533 |-79.163085 |Bar|
3|Guildwood, Morningside, West Hill |43.763573 |-79.188711 |RBC Royal Bank |43.766790 |-79.191151 |Bank |
4|Guildwood, Morningside, West Hill |43.763573 |-79.188711 |G & G Electronics |43.765309 |-79.191537 |Electronics Store |
